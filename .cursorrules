# Cursor Rules for Yalniz Olmaz Web Project

## React Server Components (RSC) Guidelines

- **RSC-first approach**: Use React Server Components by default for all components
- **"use client" directive**: Only add "use client" when interactivity is explicitly required (event handlers, state, browser APIs, etc.)
- **Server-side benefits**: Leverage server-side rendering, reduced bundle size, and better performance
- **Client components**: Reserve for components that need:
  - Event handlers (onClick, onChange, etc.)
  - React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.)
  - Browser-specific APIs (localStorage, window, etc.)
  - Third-party libraries that require client-side execution

## Code Quality

- Prefer server components for static content, data fetching, and layout components
- Keep client components small and focused on interactivity
- Use proper TypeScript types and interfaces
- Follow Next.js 13+ App Router conventions
